# A program that simulates a GUI which enables Noughts and Crosses game

"""
Project Name: Noughts and Crosses Game.

 Rules of the Game:

 1. Noughts and Crosses is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns
    marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
 2. Player 1's mark is Cross (X) and Player 2's mark is Noughts (O)
 3. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal,
    vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
 4. If both of the player fails to fulfill the wining condition, then it is
    considered as a draw.

 How the Game Works:

 1. When the program is run, a 'Welcome' window will open where player has to
    write their names. 
 2. The "Welcome" window will also contain a start button which will start the
    game and a quit button which will terminate the program when they are
    pressed. The start button will not start the game until both the player
    names are entered. The program will give an error message if Player names
    are not entered or they contain only whitespaces.
 3. Players name can not be same. In that case the program will give an error
    message and the game wont get started until the users enter their names and
    the names are different.
 4. If the players enter their names and press the start button,a "Game Window"
    will open which will contain 3x3 grid = 9 buttons with empty texts where
    players will place their marks. Player 1 will make the first move. Players
    can place marks until one of the player wins or the match is a draw.
 5. If a player wins, "Congratulations" message box will pop up which will
    contain the winner's name and the "Game Window" buttons will be disabled. 
    The "Game Result" frame will be opened where the game result is shown. 
    In case of "Draw", this frame will be opened directly without pop up the 
    "Congratulations" message box.
 6. The "Game Result" frame will contain 3 buttons:
        a. "Play Again" button will allow players to start the game again by
        opening the "Game Window". Previous game result will be stored.
        b. Scoreboard button will open "Score Board" frame which will show the
        current score. It contains 2 buttons, "Play Again" and "Quit Game".
        c. "Quit" button will terminate the program.
